# High-dimensional statistics

My homeworks for the [Statistics for high-dimensional data](https://wikidocs.univ-lorraine.fr/display/minesnancyficm/GIMAS9AD+STATISTIQUE+EN+GRANDE+DIMENSION) course of my MSc @ Mines Nancy. I use R or Python, both in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

The [boosting notebook](https://github.com/sylvaincom/high-dimensional-statistics/blob/master/boosting.ipynb) complements our report on boosting. It contains a few implementations of the methods that were studied. In particular, we compare several classifiers on several datasets (for classication). All functions (except XGBoost) and datasets come from scikit-learn.

This repository is mainly intented to my teacher, thus there are no further explanations for now. In particular, [tp3](https://github.com/sylvaincom/high-dimensional-statistics/blob/master/tp3.ipynb) is a homework assignment but I can not share the exercise statement for now.
