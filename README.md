# High-dimensional statistics

My homeworks for the [High-dimensional statistics](https://wikidocs.univ-lorraine.fr/display/minesnancyficm/GIMAS9AD+STATISTIQUE+EN+GRANDE+DIMENSION) course of my Master 2 @ Mines Nancy. We use R in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

This repository is intented to my teacher, thus there are no further explanations for now.
